Implemented several algorithms in PostgreSQL.

Algorithms implemented were :

* Finding supersets of set
* Finding vertices in a graph that are connected by an even and odd length path
* Topological sort
* Check if a graph is 3-colorable or not
* Finding out if Hamiltonian cycle in a Graph
* Finding out the t-frequent set using Apriori rule
* Kmeans
* Finding aggregated weights of all the parts
* Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path
* Simple map-reduce concepts
